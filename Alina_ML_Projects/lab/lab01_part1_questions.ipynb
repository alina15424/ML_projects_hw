    "Answer: In a distance matrix for k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), each cell represents the distance between two points in the dataset. Distinctly bright rows typically indicate data points that are far from others across the dataset. These rows suggest that certain points are more isolated or less similar to the majority of the data, leading to consistently higher distances in comparisons.\n",
    "What causes the columns?\n",

    "Answer: Bright columns in a distance matrix might represent attributes or clusters within the data that have a unique distance distribution compared to others. This could indicate a feature or group of features that make specific data points (or groups of points) consistently different from others. High distances in columns can also be caused by outlier points that vary significantly from a particular subset of data, creating a pattern in the distance matrix.\n",
